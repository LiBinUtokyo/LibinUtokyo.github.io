Cortical excitability is sensitive to noise perturbations despite homeostatic regulation. However, modeling the effect of noise in a heterogeneous neuronal population is a mathematical challenge. Using a mean‐field model of a randomly connected excitatory population, we investigated how noise affects excitability at the resting state. Stable equilibrium analysis revealed that increasing noise intensity enhances excitability, indexed by synaptic conductance. Further, this enhancement disappeared when excitability is sufficiently high due to strong mean input current, but not influenced by the connection probability of the population. Finally, the mechanism of noise‐induced enhancement was explained by eigenvalues moving toward the imaginary axis.
